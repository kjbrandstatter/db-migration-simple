DB::Migration::Simple - Simple DB migrations. Go up and down in versions.

SYNOPSIS
========

    use v6;
    use DB::Migration::Simple;
    use DBIish;

    my $dbh = DBIish.connect('SQLite', :database<example-db.sqlite3>);
    my $m = DB::Migration::Simple.new(:$dbh :migration-file<etc/migrations>);
    # optional parameter: :$verbose
    # optional parameter: :$migration-table-name

    say $m.current-version();

    $m.migrate(version<42>, :verbose); # go to version 42 and be informative
    $m.migrate(); # migrate to latest version

DESCRIPTION
===========

DB::Migration::Simple is a Perl 6 module to help with up- and downgrading
a database schema between versions.

Write an SQL-file that specifies actions for up and down migrations.

DB::Migration::Simple does not depend on certain databases or versions thereof.
It takes a dabatabase handle and trusts that the SQL you write will work with that handle.

Lines starting with an # are comments
Empty lines are ignored.

Lines starting with "-- x up" denote the next version. Versions are integers.
Comments are also allowed at the end of lines starting with "--":

`-- 31 # Version 31 has a comment`

The other lines are SQL that get sent to your database.
Separate SQL statements with semicolons.

Don't use SQL comments after a semicolon.
Only one SQL statement per line.
In fact, the semicolon has to be
the last non-whitespace character on a line.

(That is because we don't parse the SQL but just split at the semicolons
and anchor the semicolon at the end of a line to avoid splitting inside SQL.
Example: `SELECT .. FROM .. WHERE foo = ";"`.

The splitting in turn is done before sending the statements to the DB because
it looks like DBIish only supports one statement at a time. Might be wrong.)

NOK: `CREATE ...; INSERT ...;`

NOK: `CREATE ...(...); # comment`

NOK: `CREATE ...; /* comment */`


Example
-------

    -- 1 up # comment
    CREATE TABLE table_version_1( /* comment */
        # comment
        /* or, SQL style comment */
        id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
        msg TEXT
    );
    INSERT INTO table_version_1 (msg) VALUES("This is version 1");

    # comment

    --1 down
    DROP TABLE table_version_1;


    -- 2 up
    CREATE TABLE table_version_2 (msg TEXT);
    INSERT INTO table_version_2 VALUES ("This is version 2");

    -- 2 down
    DROP TABLE table_version_2;


    -- 3 up
    CREATE TABLE table_version_3 (msg TEXT);

    -- 3 down
    DROP TABLE table_version_3;


Migrating up from version 0 (empty database) to version 2 will do the following.
- Migrate to version 1, using the commands under "-- 1 up".
- Migrate to version 2, using the commands under "-- 2 up".

Migrating down from version 2 to version 1 will use the commands under "-- 2 down".

The migrations are wrapped in a transacation. In case of failure, the commands
executed are rolled back, and you are left at the version before you called `$m.migrate()`.

Verbose Mode
------------
For debugging or other reasons of interest, supply the :verbose flag

    my $m = DB::Migration::Simple.new(:$dbh, :verbose);

Metadata
--------
The migration meta information is stored in your database, in a table named "db-migration-simple-meta".
You can choose a different table name:

    $migration-table.name = 'my-own-migration-meta-table-that-suits-me-better';
    $m = DB::Migration::Simple.new(:$dbh :$migration-file :$migration-table-name);
